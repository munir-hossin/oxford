                    next day while cooking rice and reheating that day's portion of curry. While they ate they would talk about their day. Devi's parents always asked, 'What happened at school today?' They liked to hear all about it. Then
                    they would talk about their day. Dad often had a funny story to tell about his journey to work and Mum always laughed and said, 'Oh, Vinnie, you should just walk to work and save yourself all that bother.' Mum and Dad
                    always told Devi about what they had eaten for lunch. Dad often went to a restaurant, 'Today, I had such a wonderful vegetable soup, with a soft warm bread roll! It was delicious!' Mum ate in the canteen at work.
                    Sometimes she did not like the food, 'Today we had Mexican beans and tortillas. They were terrible! I wish I had taken a packed lunch.'
